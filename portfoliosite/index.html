            Hey! My name is Na'imah Bowen, I'm a second-year Software Engineering BSc student at the 
            University of Leicester. Outside of university, I am a telephone researcher and a company
            representative for Dell Technologies. I love to learn new skills and gain new knowledge from 
            documentaries, books and TV shows. I haven't decided what field of software engineering I 
            want to work in yet, but I'm open to everything. Scroll down to find out more and see my current 
            projects!

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A little more about my job, about a year ago, I secured my role with Dell which I have grown to 
        love so much! The rest of the company representatives and employees are like family to me and 
        we have a lot of laughs. On top of that, it's exciting knowing about the latest Ryzen, Intel 
        and Dell tech which is due to be released. I have formal training from those companies and 
        even though the role is more based on customer service- I still learn a lot working there.
        It's kind of the best of both worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been coding for a few years now, I have done computer science since GCSE level where
        I started by learning VB.net, Python, SQL and HTML. Since starting university last year, we have covered
        Bash, HTML & CSS (and a little bit of JavaScript), Java and more advanced python.
        Of recent, I have started learning C++ in my own time. Though I'm new to it- I really enjoy it.
        My language of preference is VB.net but that's not used too often anymore (much to my dismay :( ).
        But I'm working on doing more advanced Python projects in the coming months, including
        opinion mining AI, which I'm really looking forward to undertaking.

            This is my first GUI Java project using Swing, it was a lot of fun to make considering I'm 
            not very good the game- trying to win against the AI was a challenge for a while. I learnt
            a lot of new skills from the project.

          I used Python functions to develop this sudoku solver. That is the main skill I wanted to 
          demonstrate with this project- to make the implementation as optimal as possible in the fewest lines of code.

          By this project, I was quite comfortable with VB. The methods were easy to implement but
          my main focus was on the calculation of the financial methods and making the application useable.
